## Goals for Phase 3/Goals not Met

Main goals for Phase 3
* Enhance our search functionality
* Create a recommendation feature that recommends users projects they might be interested in on working on

Goals not met
* Autofilling information from Github, StackOverFlow, Linkedin etc... 

## Initial Planning

In this phase we planned to build almost all of our main features on our site. These features were enhancing our search functionality, creating a recommendation feature and an auto filling feature that fills user information from third party sites like Github, onto our site.

In phase 2 are search was only able to filter through tags. For this phase we aimmed to enhance our search by allowing users to filter through types of projects i.e game design, Android development, iOS development. In addition, our search would take into consideration filtering by programming languages, sorting projects by number of collaborators, in alphabetical order and by date added. 

Our recommendation feature would allow users to get a recommendation of various projects they might want to collaborate on. In more detail, it will compare your interests in projects to other projects that have similar interests. Also, it will compare your interests with other user's interests for similarities to narrow down on projects. This recommendation feature will filter the top 3 recommendations. 

The last feature which we initially wanted to complete was an auto filling information feature. On our site a user must add information like their interests, programming languages they use and more general information about themselves. Much of this information is also present on Github, StackOverFlow, Linkedin etc. if they have an account. Continuing on, when a user signs up on our site, they would have to refill this type of information, this causes redundant work for our users. To prevent this hastle and make for a more seamless user experience our auto filling information feature would load in personal data from Github, StackOverFlow etc. about a user onto our site so they would not have to manually rewrite information they might have already filled in on other sites. The reason we liked this idea was because it provides a stronger reason for users to want to use our site. 

## Changes Made

Some of the changes we made from our initial plan was to be realistic with the time constraint. Since we had an extention for phase 2 and other coursework from other classes, meeting our goal was tougher. Nonetheless, this is completely understandable, and so we decided not to pursure the auto filling information feature. Much of this decision was because of the time constraint and we were very unfamiliar with what technologies we would need to use to complete this feature. We spend lots of time researching technologies, and thinking about the issues that might arise. For example, would we need to get permission from Github to use data from their site to auto fill information onto our site? After a decent amount of research we sought a few different APis that would help us implement this feature such as [Cheerio](http://maxogden.com/scraping-with-node.html) and [Third-party login API](https://docs.strongloop.com/pages/releaseview.action?pageId=3836277). In the end, we decided to be realistic with respect to the deadline and implement our first two features and save this feature for the last phase. It is also important to note that our research in weighing different technologies to use to implement this autofilling feature did not go to waste as we will continue on and complete this feature for the final phase. 


## Progress towards MVP

We believe we have made solid progress towards our MVP because our web application primarily thrives on our extensive search functionality for users to search for various projects that they might want to collaborate on. Another key feature which we believe would be an incentive for users is our feature to recommend various projects to users that they might want to work on. Our primary goal is to make for an easy, seamless user-experience for users to search for projects to collaborate on. We believe that the main features completed during this phase makes significant progress towards our goal indefinitely because we have completed our main features for our web application.

## Plans for Next Phase

For our final phase we plan on completing our auto filling feature which we had wanted to initially planned to complete this phase. Furthermore, we want to work on the UI for our site. So far, we have been working on the major features of our site and haven't worked too much on the UI for the site because we didn't want to spend ample time on UI early on when features were not yet developed. However, for our final phase we plan to make our UI sound by making it very user friendly. We plan on testing by letting our peers navigate through our site and get a feel for it, and get their feedback. Majority of our features for our web application have been completed this phase and we plan on cleaning up and finishing off our app by next phase achieving our MVP.
