# Technical Report

## What was Built?

For this phase, we implemented user account creation, project creation and a way to view all projects and users. We also managed to implement a search function that searches tags set by users in a project.

We implemented this by using a bootstrap template to show a very early and basic version of our MVP. 

## Meaningful Artifacts (i.e. Diagrams, Source-code, ...)

Before we started the programming for our project, our group consolidated and formed the following UI diagrams for our ideal final project:

These diagrams helped us determine which features were more important than others and allowed us to set priorities on said features. For example, the inspiration behind our MVP is the idea of sharing projects itself. Therefore we felt it was important to get users applying to projects and a list of both out by this phase as it is the basis of our MVP.

For our project/user pages, we used a bootstrap template, as given by our time constraints and designing abilities. Furthermore we implemented a basic way to list projects and users, row-by-row. We also implemented user/project creation and a search function. 

## Progress towards MVP

For our MVP, our group believes that a well-refined project Page, profile page and all-purpose search function will be the key features to implement. For this phase, we made significant progress towards our MVP given that we had to reevaluate our idea and implementation. 

In this phase, our team developed sophisiticated and detailed plans that outline the plan to build the project for the remaining sprints. The team also discussed which features to implement and in which order and how to build each page. Our last meeting with Spandan helped us prioritize tasks and focus on the importants ones first. 

For our first page, a very basic project page was implemented - with a list of projects. This page serves as the primary idea and inspiration behind our MVP - a public forum of projects and features that help cement that. We also implemented a user page as users are our main target for our MVP. With this basis and foundation made, not only has a lot of progress been made but it will help set us further into the project.


## Challenges/Decisions/Issues//Lessons Learned

When working in team, there is no questions that issues will arise among the group - both technical and issues among the team itself. 

In terms of team issues, at the beginning of phase 2, members of our group left the team and did not communicate it to the rest of the group. For valuable days, our group was left not knowing the situation until the members that left were communicated with privately. With such a dilemma, our group had to completely re-evaluate our phase 1:
* What features do we want to cutback on our final MVP?
* How should we implement the backend - not use Clojure.
* How should we re-allocate tasks and roles.

The main challenge we faced during this phase was related to our team, as explained above. 
Lessons Learned: We now realize the true importance of early on decisions and the impact it can have. Specfically, one major flaw we had was choosing to use Clojure to implement our back-end when members of the group did not have experience in Clojure. Even though some group members knew Clojure we did not consider the possibility of those members leaving the team. What would the impact be as the rest of the group does not know Clojure? Also, we should have considered to let those members teach the rest of the group how to use Clojure if those members were still on the team. Overall, the lesson learnt was choose technologies all team members can use well or ensure members who do not know choosen technologies well get trained by members who do know it well.

Our team decided to stay together as we believe in our MVP. We decided to use Node.js as the back-end and to cut-back on private messaging, friends, fancy user-interfaces and more. Going along with that, everything went smoothly. 

In terms of the technical aspect, we arrived at the decision to use a bootstrap template given our time constraints and lack of UI abilities. There were issues finding a template but they were solved given time. 

## Plans for next phase

For our next phase, our team plans to work on a all purpose and sophisticated search function - allows users to search for users and projects. Also maybe implement a database for projects and users. We also plan on adding more features onto our project page such as users having the ability to like/dislike, show interest in and follow projects.
